## Key Features

### Bring your own Python

Bring the power of Visual Studio to your favorite Python interpreter! Python Tools for Visual Studio works best with [CPython](http://www.python.org/), but you can also use [IronPython](http://www.ironpython.net/), and other programs that host Python. Or download a Python distribution bundle like [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) or [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) and start exploring the Python library ecosystem.

### IntelliSense

Experience powerful IntelliSense that understands Python and provides useful completions for your own code and any libraries you are using.

### Debugging

Python support in Visual Studioâ€™s interactive debugger means you can enjoy stepping through your code with breakpoints, visualizers, and automatic exception notifications. Get to the root of problems quickly and easily with familiar Visual Studio tools. Advanced features include mixed mode (Python/C++) debugging and cross OS (Linux/MacOS) debugging.

### Iterate quickly with the Interactive Window

Use the Interactive Window to quickly iterate while developing. Take advantage of [IPython](http://www.ipython.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) integration for an interactive graphical workbench.

### Integrate with Azure


Visit the Microsoft Azure Python Developer Center for tutorials and documentation to get started. The free, open-source Python Azure SDK is an easy way to start using the Azure Management, Storage and Service Bus services directly from your Python code. Access the Azure availability, performance and usage tools by using the Application Insights SDK for Python. Include the Azure DocumentDB service in your project by using azure-documentdb-python. Use Azure Active Directory for OAuth authentication on a Python web site by following the example in azure-python-authenticate.



### Create instant web sites

Create, test, and deploy web sites written with Python and debug them from your desk while they run on your Linux or Windows-based server or on Microsoft Azure.
