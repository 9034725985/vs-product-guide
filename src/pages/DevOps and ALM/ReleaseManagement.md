### Release Management Service (preview)

The next set of major improvements in the Release Management Service of Visual Studio Online is coming in preview this summer. Updates to Release Management will include a Web interface and integration with the new next-generation Visual Studio Online Build system. The Release Management Service also can pick up apps for other build systems, such as Jenkins, and will deploy through Chef, Docker, or Azure resource groups, as well as to on-premises servers from Visual Studio Online.
