### Build vNext (Preview)

vNext of the Visual Studio Online Build service, in preview, will be available to all users in mid-2015. The next-generation build system will enable teams to more easily create custom-build workflows by introducing reusable tasks and leverages a lightweight, Web-based authoring environment.

This build system will also be capable of building code from external systems such as GitHub by leveraging the REST APIs and service hooks infrastructure available in Visual Studio Online. As well, a new cross-platform build agent will allow teams to run builds on non-Windows machines. This makes it possible, for the first time, to build on Linux and Mac OS X machines. Team Foundation Server 2015 also includes in-box support for Ant, Maven, and Gradle.
