### New Extensibility Model

REST APIs enable customers and the community to develop custom solutions, making it possible to extend and integrate Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server into almost any scenario. In addition, service hooks make it easy to integrate with external services such as Trello or Campfire, and to build an app experience that is instantly notified when events are triggered, such as completed builds, commits/check-ins or work item changes.
