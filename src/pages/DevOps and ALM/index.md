## DevOps & Application Lifecycle Management

We like to say that [Visual Studio Online](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs) is not an IDE, it's everything else. Visual Studio Online provides a set of cloud-powered collaboration tools that work with your existing IDE or editor, so your team can work effectively on all types of software projects.

Visual Studio Online delivers continuous innovation services for agile team collaboration and DevOps, such as the new agile planning and Kanban enhancements and the next-generation build system that builds any application on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.

Team Foundation Server 2015 RC gives on-premises customers many of these same capabilities. On-premises TFS build servers are also easily linked to Visual Studio Online: see [Deploy and configure a build server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181712.aspx) in the MSDN Library to learn more.

_For more details, see [Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server at Build 2015](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2015/04/29/visual-studio-and-team-foundation-server-at-build-2015.aspx) and the [Team Foundation Server 2015 RC release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-vs)._
