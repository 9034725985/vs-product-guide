### Additional Features

- **Quick code editing:** users directly edit code files using their Web browser, through the Web access interface. Changes to files are committed back to the source code repository without the need for additional tools.
- **Expanded Basic license:** users with a Basic license to Team Foundation Server have access to Web-based test execution, team rooms, work item chart authoring, and agile portfolio planning tools.
- **SonarQube:** SonarQube is the de facto open source software solution for controlling technical debt. Builds in Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Online send code analysis and coverage data to SonarQube for deep analysis and problem prioritization.
