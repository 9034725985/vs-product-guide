## Edit on the Kanban board

You can edit the "Assigned to" and "Effort" fields on Kanban board cards right on the card without opening the work item form, first. Learn more about [working with Kanban boards in TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/work-from-the-kanban-board-vs).

## Adding and editing directly from the Kanban board

All the cards have a slightly updated look—cards are now a bit wider, and have a solid white background (instead of a colored background). Why the changes? We're laying the groundwork for more customization options on the cards, including adornments, additional fields, and tags. We’ve also updated all boards to support adding new cards and inline editing. The Kanban board now has a New item button at the top of the first column that adds a new card.

After you add a new card, all data on the card can be edited directly from the card itself. Learn more about [Kanban inline adding and editing](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2015-feb-18-vso).

## Reordering on the Kanban board

We've turned on reordering items on the board. You can now move items up and down in priority within each column on your board. Any changes made on the board are also reflected directly on the backlog. In fact, with this change, many of you may choose to use the board over the backlog, as the board now supports adding, inline editing, and reordering.

## Split columns on the Kanban board

We’ve added a new feature to our Kanban board called “Split Columns”. Kanban teams use a pull model to move work through the board. To do this effectively, each column on your board is split into two subcolumns—Doing and Done. Moving a card into the Done column provides a clear signal that work is ready to progress, and that the card can be pulled by the person/team who owns that next stage. To split any of the columns on your board, simply click the Customize Columns link on the toolbar. Learn more about [Kanban split columns](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2015-feb-18-vso).

## Kanban definition of done

As work moves through your board, it's critical that you and your team are on the same page about what “done” means for each column. This release brings a new capability that lets you specify a definition of done for each column on your board. Columns with a definition now include a small icon in the header that communicates the agreed-upon definition.
