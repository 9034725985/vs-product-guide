## Application Insights

Application Insights is an analytics solution for any app that brings together Application Performance Management and Usage Analytics, which provides development teams with a comprehensive 360Â° view across their application's performance, availability, and usage. Visual Studio 2015 includes single-click instrumentation for Windows, ASP.NET, and WCF projects.

Application Insights has reached the public preview milestone with new capabilities that complement existing support for cloud-based and Windows-based apps by integrating [HockeyApp's](http://hockeyapp.net/features/) cross-platform capabilities to deliver crash analytics for iOS and Android apps.

Application Insights is available today for customers to use on the [Azure portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/).
