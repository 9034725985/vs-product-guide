### Blend

Blend has been redesigned in Visual Studio 2015, making it the preferred tool for creating beautiful user interfaces with XAML. A new look that matches Visual Studio improves the workflow between the two products, including a Blend-exclusive dark theme to improve contrast between the tool and your content.

New features include IntelliSense for XAML, basic debugging capabilities, Peek in XAML to view and edit XAML controls in context, an improved file reload experience, custom window layouts, and support for NuGet.
