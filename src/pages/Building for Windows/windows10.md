### Windows 10: the Universal Windows Platform

True to its origins, Visual Studio 2015 remains the premier development environment for the latest platform release, Windows 10, and the Universal Windows Platform. Visual Studio 2015 supports building apps for all Windows devices by using a variety of languages including C#, Visual Basic, C++, and HTML/JavaScript, and including single-checkbox instrumentation for Application Insights. Apps built with C# or Visual Basic can also be compiled to .NET Native, which improves startup time up to 60% and run time performance to around 15-20%.

A key characteristic of universal Windows apps is that they dynamically adapt to a wide variety of screen sizes. Device previews in Visual Studio 2015 let you see your user experience adapting in the designer. Emulators and visual diagnostic tools then help you test all the variations at run time.
