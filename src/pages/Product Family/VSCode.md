Visual Studio Code is a free cross-platform code editor for building modern Web and cloud applications (in preview as of the release of Visual Studio 2015). It extends the Visual Studio family by offering a lightweight code editor that runs natively on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It provides intelligent code authoring and navigation in a lightweight, fast, keyboard-centric tool, along with integrated debugging and Git support.

### Code-focused editing

A lightweight editor with first-class keyboard-centric gestures and multiple cursors means you never need to reach for the mouse. Instantly open large or small files and focus on your code without distraction. Leverage advanced editing features such as multiple cursors, auto-save, and more.

### Code navigation: RegEx find, outlining, peek definition

Keep in context as you move through large code files and across your code base. The enhanced scrollbar highlights issues in the current file, integrated find supports regular expressions. Code outlining, navigate to and peek definition help you get where you need to be fast.

### Code understanding: IntelliSense, linting, refactoring

IntelliSense describes APIs as you type, auto-completing to increase speed and accuracy. Quick Info tool tips let you inspect API definitions, and “Squiggles” let you know about issues, often showing them as you type.

### Debugging: Break, watch, inspect

Diagnose issues with your application with integrated debugging tools for Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Set breakpoints in your code, break on exceptions, watch variables, step through your code, or navigate up the call stack, as well as attaching to local running processes.

### Git version control: Commit, diff, pull and push

Embrace modern workflows with the power and flexibility of Git. See changed files, diffs, and make commits right from within the editor. Connect with the entire Git universe by pulling and pushing code to any remote—GitHub, Azure Web Apps, Visual Studio Online, and more.
