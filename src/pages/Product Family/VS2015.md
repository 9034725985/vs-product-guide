With Visual Studio 2015 RC, developers get new functionality that was not previously available in past releases, plus a go-live license, making it ready for use on production projects.

With this release, Visual Studio product lineup now includes the new Visual Studio Enterprise Edition. With Visual Studio Enterprise, customers get the advantage of the most powerful edition of the product, and at a lower price point than Visual Studio Ultimate 2013; you can read more in our blog post: [Announcing the Visual Studio 2015 Product Lineup](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/03/31/announcing-the-visual-studio-2015-product-line.aspx).

Visual Studio 2015 (RC) product highlights include:

- **Cross-platform mobile development.** Build cross-platform mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows. Developers can use the Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova to build apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, use Visual C++ cross-platform library development, or build native apps using C# with Xamarin. A free edition of Xamarin—the Xamarin Starter Edition—is included with Visual Studio 2015.
- **Cross-platform server development.** Developers can build cross-platform server applications and deploy them to Windows and Linux servers. With Visual Studio 2015, they can use the programming language of their choice and enjoy rich tooling support for ASP.NET 5, Python, Node.js, and the new open-source .NET Core 5 that supports Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The preview of Visual Studio Tools for Docker also helps developers deploy their .NET Core applications directly to Docker containers.
- **Windows development.** Build the next generation of Windows apps and games for the Universal Windows Platform that run across all Windows 10 devices, including phones, tablets, PCs, and Xbox, as well as IoT and HoloLens. New diagnostic tools, new features in Blend, and the .NET Framework 4.6 deliver extended capabilities to both Windows Store and WPF developers alike.
- **Productivity enhancements.** In addition to a variety of IDE improvements, Visual Studio 2015 introduces a much richer debugging experience, which now includes integrated, advanced capabilities such as performance monitoring and historical debugging in the same experience. Also, Microsoft has added many new features for managed-code developers through .NET Compiler Platform, such as Light Bulbs to help fix common code issues, improved refactoring tools, and live code analysis that automates code fixes while you're typing.
