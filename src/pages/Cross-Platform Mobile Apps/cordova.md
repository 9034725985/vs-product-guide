Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova enables developers to use their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript) skills to write and debug hybrid apps that require little or no platform-specific customizations.

To make it easy for developers to get started with Apache Cordova, Visual Studio 2015 automates the installation of the many Cordova dependencies, such as the Android SDK and the Java SDK. Building apps is fast, with nearly 100% of your code shared across all platforms. Cordova plugins, which are easily installed and managed within Visual Studio, provide access to a wide range of native platform capabilities.

Developers can use whatever JavaScript frameworks and libraries they choose and then take full advantage of Visual Studio's powerful code editors, which include IntelliSense, extensive debugging capabilities on all platforms, and the ability to test in emulators or on physical devices.
