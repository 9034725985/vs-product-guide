[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com) tools combined with Visual Studio empowers developers to write and debug fully native cross-platform mobile apps by using C# and .NET, with 75% to nearly 100% shared code across platforms. Developers get the benefits of using C# and .NET and also powerful Visual Studio IDE features like CodeLens and third-party extensions.

Visual Studio 2015 also includes the free Xamarin Starter Edition, making it easier for developers to get started with Xamarin without the need to install it separately.
