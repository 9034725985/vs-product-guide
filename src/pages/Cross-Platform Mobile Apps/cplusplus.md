Visual Studio 2015 adds new capabilities that enable Visual C++ developers to build cross-platform mobile code that runs on Android, iOS, and Windows, all from a shared code base.

Developers can target an existing C++ library to Android and Windows platforms, or use these C++ libraries with other project types such as Xamarin or Java Native Interface apps. It's even possible to build Android Native Activity applications all within Visual Studio. All these scenarios take full advantage of the Visual Studio IDE, including IntelliSense, Debugging, Source Control Integration, and much more.
