The newly open-sourced .NET Core brings everything you need to run .NET code on multiple server platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Developers can also run .NET inside Docker containers on Linux (in preview).

With .NET Core, developers can build ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and Web Pages (Razor) on multiple platforms, making ASP.NET truly a cross-platform server technology for building websites on all deployment environments.

Developers can now install the .NET Core support for Linux and Mac OS X, start an evaluation of this early preview, and get involved in the associated open source project, overseen by the .NET Foundation.
