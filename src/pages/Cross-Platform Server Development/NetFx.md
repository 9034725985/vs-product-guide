### .NET Framework 4.6 RC, ASP.NET 5 (Beta 4), and Entity Framework 7 (Beta 4)

The latest version of the .NET Framework includes the next-generation JIT compiler, CLR performance improvements, DateTime to Unix time support, garbage collector updates, cryptography updates, and compatibility switches.

Both ASP.NET 5 (Beta 4) and Entity Framework 7 (Beta 4) have been designed to be ready for cloud deployments by reducing its memory footprint and increasing its throughput. Both are also open source and cross platform and are able to run on the traditional .NET Framework 4.6 and the new cloud-optimized .NET Core 5.
