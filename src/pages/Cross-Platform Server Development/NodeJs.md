Node.js is a platform built on the JavaScript runtime of Google Chrome, which you can run on various platforms including Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. With Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, developers can take advantage of an official Microsoft open-sourced extension that enables first-class Visual Studio tooling support for Node.js projects.

In this release, we've added support for Visual Studio 2015 and made enhancements to the code-formatting experience, among other improvements.

We've also enabled support for a newly-released IoT extension that enables developers to deploy Node.js-based Universal Windows apps to Windows IoT Core devices like Raspberry Pi 2, and extends some of the IntelliSense and debugging functionality. Download the Node.js Tools for Visual Studio IoT extension from the [Windows Embedded Pre-Release Program](https://connect.microsoft.com/windowsembeddedIoT/Downloads/) (it is necessary to sign in and join that program to download the extension).
