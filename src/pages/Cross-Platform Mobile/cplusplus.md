Developers can target an existing C++ library to Android and Windows platforms, or use these C++ libraries with other project types such as Xamarin or Java Native Interface apps. It's even possible to build Android Native Activity applications all within Visual Studio. All these scenarios take full advantage of the Visual Studio IDE, including IntelliSense, Debugging, Source Control Integration, and much more.

Visual Studio 2015 includes support for Android API Level 21 (Lollipop). In addition, you can select all the dependencies you need to install direct from Visual Studio setup, including the Android Native Development Kit, the Android SDK, Apache Ant, the Java SE Development Kit.

With Visual Studio 2015 and Visual C++, you can do the following:
 
- Create projects from templates for Android Native Activity apps, or for shared code libraries that you can use on multiple platforms and in Xamarin native Android applications.
- Use platform-specific IntelliSense to explore APIs and generate correct code for Android or Windows targets.
- Configure your build for x86 or ARM native platforms. 
- Deploy your code to attached Android devices or use Microsoft's performant Android emulator for testing. 
- Set breakpoints, watch variables, view the stack and step through code in the Visual Studio debugger.
- Use a template that is based on make file support for Android, which allows using an external build system (including NDK- BUILD).-  
- View the message log from an Android device by using the LogCat viewer. (Logcat is a diagnostic tool and essential for a good edit->build->debug experience.) 
Use Logcat to do the following:
	- Search for specific log messages by using search bar. 
	- Use Toggle Autoscroll to view upcoming log messages easily.
	- Clear previous log output messages.
	- Choose between various log levels.
- Write C++ code targeting the iOS platform and also be able to take advantage of our advanced code authoring features, such as code sharing, cross-platform IntelliSense, refactoring, peek definition, and more.
- Leverage popular Clang/GCC based toolchains to build Android native binaries. Easily add new files, use property pages to fine-tune compiler settings for building, debugging, and optimizing your cross-platform binary. You can also use advanced features like pre-compiled headers to speed up build times.
