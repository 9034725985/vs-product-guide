### Debugging & Diagnostics

- **PerfTips** bring performance awareness into the debugging experience by indicating elapsed time for one or more lines of code as they are run in the debugger. This saves tremendous time over running separate diagnostic tools and navigating the output.
- **New**** Diagnostic Tools window** with Debugger Break events, Memory Usage tool, and CPU Usage graph, all integrated with the debugger and available during regular debugging sessions.
- **Breakpoint configuration in Peek Definition window** greatly simplifies configuring breakpoints with conditions and actions. The modeless UI allows developers to go back and forth between code and breakpoint configurations. (See picture below.)
- **Lambda debugging support** including in the Immediate and Watch windows. Edit and Continue in the debugger also works with lambdas and async functions.
- **New**** Exceptions window**, addressing the many customer "pain points" in the previous experience.
- **Redesigned IntelliTrace** for historical debugging within the new Diagnostic Tools window.
- **Filter errors and warnings** makes it easier for developers to prioritize corrections. Visual Studio 2015 also includes links on error codes to help developers quickly find the information needed to resolve those errors.
