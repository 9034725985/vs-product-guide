The Developer Assistant is an extension for Visual Studio that combines the power of Bing and the Visual Studio IDE to give personalized and contextual help for finding code samples and projects.

In this release, the Bing team [has worked with GitHub](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/04/30/github-integration-in-developer-assistant.aspx), the largest code host in the world, to index millions of code samples residing in GitHub and provide just-in-time assistance for developers targeting .NET APIs and popular open source languages and frameworks.
