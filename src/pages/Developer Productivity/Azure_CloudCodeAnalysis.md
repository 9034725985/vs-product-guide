### Azure Cloud Code Analysis Pack (Beta)

[Download the NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Azure.CodeAnalysis/)

Azure Cloud Code Analysis Pack is a NuGet package that implements the code analysis capabilities of the .NET Compiler Platform in Visual Studio 2015 to identify coding patterns that cause performance, scalability, or security problems in Azure applications.

By adding the Azure Cloud Code Analysis NuGet package to a project, developers can detect code issues in real time as the code is being written in the editor. Some code analysis rules also suggest automatic fixes to code.
