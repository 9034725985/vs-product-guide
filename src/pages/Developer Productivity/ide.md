### IDE Improvements

- **Live code analysis and LightBulb** provides quick access to actions for code corrections, opportunistic changes, and refactoring. Visual Studio 2015 also does this on a solution level, and the functionality can be customized through extensions to the Roslyn analyzer. (See image below.)
- **Customized window layouts** let developers optimize the Visual Studio workspace for different project types and monitor configurations. Save up to ten distinct window layouts and easily switch between them with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Single sign-in** for Visual Studio and connected services like Azure keeps developers focused on their tasks instead of entering credentials. This includes configuring enterprise single sign-in for web projects using Azure Active Directory.
- **Touch gestures in the Visual Studio editor** give developers flexible input modalities, and are especially powerful with large touch screens in team collaboration environments. Gestures include scrolling, pinch-zoom, line selection, and press-and-hold to invoke context menus.
- **Add Connected Services** makes it easy for developers to consume service APIs in their client and web applications including Microsoft Services such as Office 365 APIs, Azure Storage, and third-party services (through extensions).
- **Javascript IntelliSense** supports IntelliSense for third-party JavaScript libraries using standard JsDoc comments, and IntelliSense for libraries based on Require.js.
