## Welcome to Visual Studio 2015

Visual Studio aspires to be for very developer and every team, any app on any platform. Microsoft continues a long-standing dedication to help developers achieve more. Microsoft introduced its first BASIC interpreter in 1975. It unveiled Visual C++ and Visual Studio in the mid-1990s. Visual Studio 2015 reinforces our dedication to just that. 

Visual Studio 2015 extends beyond traditional platforms. It enables developers to target a rich set of mobile platforms including iOS, Android, and Windows. Mobile development is possible with in-box Apache Cordova platform support and C++ cross-platform library development, Xamarin for building native apps using C# and Visual Studio, and Unity for building graphics and gaming apps. And Visual Studio Code, in preview, brings a powerful editing experience to developers working on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. This is in addition to Visual Studio 2015 delivering many new features for web, cloud, and Windows development. 

Developers can also take advantage of our continued investment into Python and Node.js tooling, which brings the full power of Visual Studio to the expanding range of problems to which these languages are being applied. And in combination with the open-source .NET Core, ASP.NET 5, and Entity Framework 7, developers have rich choices for building server-side applications on  on Windows Server, Linux, or Mac OS X.

Modern development depends on much more than just code. Team agility across the entire development lifecycle is critical to the continuous delivery that customers expect. From team collaboration, to DevOps and release management, to cross-platform monitoring in production environments, the Visual Studio 2015 family—including Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server 2015, with new support for non-Windows platforms and third-party tools—gives teams the flexibility to create the environment they need, both in the cloud and on-premises.
